Feature Extraction: librosa is used to extract MFCC features from speech audio files. User may need to adjust feature extraction based on their specific audio processing needs.

Distance Calculation: Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance is computed between extracted features of audio (MFCC) and text features (simulated here).

Optimal Alignment: The linear_sum_assignment function from scipy.optimize is used to find the optimal alignment between audio features and transcript features based 
on calculated DTW distances.

Output: Aligned pairs of indices between audio features and transcript features are printed.
